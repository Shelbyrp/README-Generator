  ## Description
  This application was created as itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for any open source project on GitHub. Each of the projects should have a readme file to describe the application, how it is built, if others did contribute or can contribute, information about the license and credit to any resources used.

  The benefit of having this application is that you will save time writing the readme file, there is consistency and you will not miss any crucial information. The user is simply prompted to answer questions in the command line and then once every question is answered, the readme file is generated.

  To create this application, the Inquirer package was used. JavaScript has been utilised to create the program also.

  Here is a link to a demo video with a detailed description of how to use this application: [demo video](https://youtu.be/VzmHMKuU32I)
